# CV-Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! 
Here you will find a collection of projects focused on computer vision techniques and applications. These projects showcase my skills and knowledge in this field, and demonstrate how I can apply these techniques to real-world problems.

* One of the projects you will find here is the Day_and_Night_Image_Classifier, which is a machine learning model that can classify an image as either a daytime or nighttime scene. It uses deep learning techniques to accurately classify the images.

* Another project is the Face_detection_video_resnet, which uses the ResNet architecture to detect faces in a video stream in real-time. This project demonstrates my ability to work with deep learning models for object detection.

* The Haar_Cascade,_Face_Detection project uses Haar cascades, a machine learning-based approach, to detect faces in images. This project demonstrates my understanding of traditional computer vision techniques.

* The Hand_Gesture_Contour_detection_and_features project uses contour detection and feature extraction to recognize hand gestures in images. This project showcases my ability to work with image processing techniques and apply them to gesture recognition.

* The Histogram_Equalization project demonstrates my understanding of image processing techniques, specifically histogram equalization, and how it can be used to improve the contrast of an image.

* Finally, the Object_dectection_using_ORB project uses ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature detection to detect objects in images. This project demonstrates my ability to work with feature detection and object detection techniques.

I hope you enjoy exploring these projects, and if you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me.
